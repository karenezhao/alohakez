#' Aboveground plant biomass and density in control and fertilized plots in a Spartina alterniflora-dominated marsh, Rowley River, Plum Island Ecosystem LTER, MA.
#'
#' Aboveground plant biomass and density is determined non-destructively during the growing season at a Spartina alterniflora-dominated salt marsh on the Rowley River within the Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site.
