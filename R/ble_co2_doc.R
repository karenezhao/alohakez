#' Carbon flux from aquatic ecosystems of the Arctic Coastal Plain along the Beaufort Sea, Alaska, 2010-2018
#'
#' Multiple aquatic ecosystems (pond, lake, river, lagoon, ocean) on the Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) near UtqiaÄ¡vik, AK were visited to determine their relative contribution to landscape-level atmospheric CO2 flux and how this may have changed over time.
