#' characteristics of HOAs in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area, and corresponding animal (bird or arthropod) and plant diversity within those communities. The Shannon diversity index is commonly used to characterize species diversity in a community. It accounts for both abundance and evenness of the species present.
